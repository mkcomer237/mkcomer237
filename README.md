### Guide to my github projects


**Algorithm implementation from scratch**

Here I have a few ML algorithms that I implemented from scratch using python and Numpy as learning exercises
- [Multi layer perceptron](https://github.com/mkcomer237/Neural_Network_From_Scratch)
- [Linear regression](https://github.com/mkcomer237/linreg_from_scratch)

[Udacity Intermediate python nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intermediate-python-nanodegree--nd303)

This was a 2 month in depth python course focused on building python knowdedge, and learning best practices for writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. 
- [Near earth object detector](https://github.com/mkcomer237/udacity_near_earth_objects)
- [Meme generator app](https://github.com/mkcomer237/udacity_meme_generator)

[Udacity deep learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)

I'm most of the way through this 4 month course which builds a strong foundation in deep learning and its applications to computer vision, NLP, and generative networks, as well as deploying a model in the cloud.  

- [Landmark image classifier](https://github.com/mkcomer237/udacity_landmark_classifier)
- [Skin cancer detector](https://github.com/mkcomer237/udacity_dermatologist_ai)
- [TV script generator](https://github.com/mkcomer237/udacity_tv_script_generation)
- [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model](https://github.com/mkcomer237/sagemaker-deployment/blob/master/Project/SageMaker%20Project.ipynb)

[Coursera deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#courses)
I completed the first two courses in the specialization, and integrated many of the learnings into my MLP from scratch project above.  

[Coursera mathematics for machine learning: linear algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning?specialization=mathematics-machine-learning)
I also complemented this with extensive self study of Strang's linear algebra textbook.

**Kaggle**

I've been using kaggle to build out experience with more difficult ML problems. See my kaggle profile [here](https://www.kaggle.com/max237).
